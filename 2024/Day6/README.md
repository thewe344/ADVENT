# Day six
## way much overhead

First part was finished with a jiff. Pretty easy and good solution. Straight forward.

Part 2 got me, started out with a solution, that i whole heartedly thought was going to work but wasa o^infinite .

Changed model and implemented a node search instead, so for each time the guard takes a turn, that is added as a node, then if that move happens again (orientation, and position), i would know he/her have been there before.
