# Day one of advent of code 2024
## Up for a rough start
started with a mission to do everything recursive, dont know why but just wanted to try.

I thought it would be easiest to place the two different list in a struct. And when reading the file and loading them in to the struct, sorting them from the beginning.

This worked well and made it easier too find the difference in the end, because they had the same index now. Would probably been faster to just ju sort, but minimize already existing stuff. 

In the function *find_distance* i was to lazy and just whent with a for loop instead of recursive. But i Think i solved it pretty good, using the already made for loop for, finding the difference, to find the *similarity*. 

Beacuse the list was already sorted, it was easy to count them and put them in a map, once mapped, dont have to look them up again.

Overall, pretty good, my goal was to do as much as i possibly could without using libraries, but got lazy a few times.

Will se what the next one brings!
