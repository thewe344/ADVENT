# Day Two
## Today i was feeling it
Yeah so i was feeling it today, then my fridge broke, then my kitchen piped cloged. Took me the whole day to get that done.

Started late, tired and missread everything twice or a sixth time.

This code is ugla as hell, code replica, unused variables, short of error handling

But i finaly made it. 

The first part was fine, and at first i found a neat solution, but i totally screwed that up when starting on part two.

Just got real tired and missed what the actual objective was. Got it in the end

Might come back and clean up the code some day.
