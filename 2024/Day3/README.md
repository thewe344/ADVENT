# Day Three
## Today i was feeling it
This one felt easier then yesterday.

Wanted to use regex on this one, which i found out was a bit trickier then i remembered. 

I think my regex string formats are bad in this case, but hey, it works. But just exactly for this.

Dont know much about optimization here, maybe a few ifs and for loops but feels good. Maybe could have included a few error handling.

Something i might try in the future is to read directly from the input stream instead of each line, we'll se.

Need to do some more regex!
